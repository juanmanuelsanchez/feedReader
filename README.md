# feedReader

## 1.-Project Description
  ------------------------
Creates a feed reader application with articles taken from Udacity Blog, CSS Tricks,
HTML5 Rocks and Linear Digressions. Firstly it'll show a list view of articles taken 
Udacity Blog by default. At the top left corner there's a menu-icon-link to display 
a menu with other feed suggestions from other sites. These suggestions are 
clickable and, when clicked, the app will show additional articles taken from those sites.
The program is implemented with Test Driven development pattern, so when the user is running the
application there's a group of test suites that are running at the same time. 
In order to run the application, follow the instructions detailed on the second paragraph.

## 2.-Instructions to run the program
  ------------------------------------
1) Click the `index.html` file to run the application.
2) Click on one of the feed suggestions listed to read the related article.
3) Click on the top left corner's menu-icon-link to display the feed list view menu,
   and choose another one to read if you wish.
